    <h2>Lay Summary</h2>
    <p>With the proliferation of next-gen sequencing technologies, many new techniques appeared to take advantage of faster and cheaper sequencing. One such technique, RNA-Seq, involves the extraction and sequencing of RNA from a culture of cells with the goal of identifying which genes are being expressed and to what extent. Single cell RNA-Seq is a more advanced form of this practice, which allows researchers to analyse the RNA contents of a single cell instead of a homogenised mix of cells as before. This precision bring many advantages such as the ability to investigate differing expression patterns in a developing embryo with very few cells. However, because a single cell has a very small amount of RNA in it, the extracted material has to be amplified through the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This amplification has the effect of intensifying existing variation in the sample and sometimes introducing biases of its own. Several methods exist to combat these ill effects of amplification, one of which is the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs).</p>
    <p>UMIs are short sequences of DNA that are appended to the RNA molecules before they are amplified, essentially giving researchers a window into the cellular environment before any biases are introduced. Theoretically, UMIs can do this because their sequences are random and they themselves do not have any effect on amplification. In reality, these assumptions were found to be at least partially wrong based on the analyses of fission yeast data in this report. Several biases were discovered that could not be easily explained given the data. Some indication of these biases was found in data from human cells as well, but the results were inconclusive.</p>
